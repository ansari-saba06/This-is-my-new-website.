        Makhan Malai, also known as Malaiyo in regions like Varanasi, is a traditional North Indian winter sweet known for its ethereal texture and delicate flavor.
        Made by boiling full-fat milk with cream and then exposing it overnight to the cool winter air and dew, it transforms into a light, frothy dessert with a
        mousse-like consistency. The cooled milk is gently whipped in the morning to incorporate air, resulting in a cloud-like treat that melts in the mouth. 
        Flavored with saffron, cardamom, and rose or kewra essence, Makhan Malai is typically garnished with slivers of almonds or pistachios and often adorned with
        edible silver leaf (varak). It's a seasonal specialty found mostly from November to February in cities like Lucknow, Varanasi, and Kanpur, where itâ€™s served 
        fresh in small portions, often in clay cups. The uniqueness of this sweet lies in its dependency on natural cold air and dew, making it a rare and cherished winter delight.
