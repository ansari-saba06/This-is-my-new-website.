    <div>Utter Pradesh Famous Sweets</div>
    <p>
        Uttar Pradesh, a culturally rich and diverse state in northern India, is renowned for its wide variety of traditional sweets that reflect its deep-rooted culinary heritage.
        Among the most famous is Balushahi, a flaky, deep-fried sweet soaked in sugar syrup, often enjoyed during festivals and weddings. Peda, especially the Mathura Peda, is a
        soft, milk-based sweet that is iconic across India, deeply associated with the birthplace of Lord Krishna. Another delicacy, Makhan Malai (also called Malaiyo in Varanasi),
        is a seasonal winter sweet made by exposing milk to dew overnight, resulting in a light, airy foam delicately flavored with saffron and cardamom. Imarti, made with urad dal
        batter and soaked in sugar syrup, is another specialty often found in sweet shops and religious offerings. In eastern UP, Thekua, a deep-fried jaggery and wheat flour sweet,
        holds cultural importance during Chhath Puja. From the royal kitchens of Lucknow to the bustling lanes of Banaras and Mathura, the sweets of Uttar Pradesh are not just treats 
        but traditions passed down through generations, enjoyed during festivals, religious rituals, and everyday life.
