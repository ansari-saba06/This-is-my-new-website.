    <p>Balushahi is made by deep-frying a dough made from all-purpose flour and ghee until it turns golden brown.
        It is then dipped in a sugar syrup, which infuses it with sweetness and creates a soft,tecture. This delectable
        treat is often garnished with pistachios or almonds for an extra touch of indulgence.The primary ingredients in Badusha,
        such as ghee and flour, contribute to its richness and flavor, while also providing energy. Ghee, in particular, 
        is known for its health benefits, including aiding digestion and supporting heart health when consumed in moderation.</p>
