        of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, and is often flavored with rose water and garnished with pistachios. Petha is also known as "Agra ka 
        petha" and has a Geographical Indication (GI) tag.Petha is primarily made from ash gourd (also known as winter melon, white 
        gourd, or raakh laukee), sugar, and sometimes lime water.Petha, a soft, translucent Indian candy, is believed to have 
        originated in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, around 400 years ago. The story goes that he 
        commissioned a sweet as pure and white as the marble Taj Mahal, leading to the creation of petha from ash gourd.
